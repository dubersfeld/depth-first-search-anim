# depth-first-search-anim
Java based demonstration of Depth First Search algorithm using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and AJAX with animation.

I present here a Java based demonstration of the Depth First Search algorithm.

The algorithm itself is implemented in Java. Javascript is used for initialization and display only.

The browser sends a single Ajax request to the server that sends back a response that contains a collection of all intermediate search results with a new discovery at each step. Then this collection is used for animation.

The root context when deployed on Tomcat is depth-first-search

For a step-by-step demonstration of the DFS algorithm please visit this repository:
